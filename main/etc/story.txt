    Ethan hates this spark is his friend
    Starly runs away to the castle
    Ethan chases her and enters the castle and beats her (in a boss battle)
    Ethan gets the first GRAND STAR

notes from chapter1:  
    Spark will be in this game i changed my mind
    The chase sequence was inspired by another Mario fan game Super Mario and the Rainbow Stars

chapter2: 
    Ethan travels to a western like desert to warn Spark about Starly and finds himself going through different levels to just see Spark
    Ethan goes through an oil factory in one level (probably going to be 2-3 aka level 9) 
    Ethan meets Spark they discuss their plan and then a Robber tries to kill them both (the robber is the boss fight)
    Ethan defeats the robber and appearently the robber has the 2nd GRAND STAR and Ethan collects it 

notes from chapter2:
    who is protecting the desert from the robber????
    NOT going to add guns into the western theme 
      

chapter3:
    Ethan goes to a freezing tundra and has to find a mysterious relic and put it into the igloo
    Suprisingly Starly is in the igloo and wants revenge... (Starly is the boss fight)
    Ethan fights Starly and collects the 3rd GRAND STAR

notes from chapter3:
    I appearently didnt know how to spell igloo LOL

    Ethan finds himself in a pumpkin patch and is wondering why the pumpkins are there
    Ethan then finds some pumpkin goombas (in the levels)

    Ethan heared a legend about a treasure in a volcano
    Ethan and Spark went into the volcano and try to find the treasure
